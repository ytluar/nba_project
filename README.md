As I am a huge basketball fan, I always like to look at the stats for each game in NBA. Therefore, I always wondered what key stats besides the total points scored can actually contribute to a win the most. Therefore, I tried to use the stats for a game (not number of points of course) as the features for a logistic regression model to predict the winner of a NBA game.
